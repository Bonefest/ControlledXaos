Used DB: CouchDB, it's using port 5984

To communicate with it, we've created (temporarily) a public database 'attractors_db'.
Basically, we are working with a local DB (through PouchDB framework), which is talking (replicating) info with the remote DB (CouchDB).

To workaround CORS, we use `adb reverse tcp:5984 tcp:5984`, so that the same origin is applied.xb

Finally, on Android, we've enabled 'usesCleartextTraffic'.
